# Ableton Hub

## What is Ableton Hub?

Ableton Hub is a desktop application that helps you organize, manage, and discover your Ableton Live projects across multiple locations. Whether your projects are on your computer, external drives, network shares, or cloud storage, Ableton Hub scans and indexes them all in one place. Creating collections of your projects and mapping exports to projects with deep learning of your project stats.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Find projects quickly** - Search across all your projects by name, tempo, plugins, or tags
- **Organize with collections** - Create albums, EPs, or custom collections to group related projects
- **Track your exports** - Automatically find and link exported audio files to their source projects
- **Launch with Live** - Open any project directly in Ableton Live with your preferred version
- **Discover patterns** - See which plugins and devices you use most across your projects

Built with Python (programming language) and PyQt6 (GUI framework), Ableton Hub provides powerful tools for music producers to maintain their project libraries and seamlessly integrate with their Ableton Live workflow.

</div>

</details>

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered architecture:

**UI Layer (PyQt6 - GUI framework)**
- Main Window orchestrates all UI components
- Sidebar Navigation provides access to locations, collections, and Live installations
- Project Grid/List View displays projects with multiple view modes
- Search & Filter Bar enables full-text search and advanced filtering
- Collection View manages static and smart collections
- Health Dashboard visualizes project health metrics

**Service Layer**
- Project Scanner discovers and indexes `.als` files
- File System Watcher monitors for real-time changes
- ALS Parser extracts metadata from project files
- Live Version Detector finds installed Ableton Live versions
- Live Launcher opens projects with specific Live versions
- Link Network Scanner discovers Ableton Link devices
- Export Tracker identifies and links exported audio files
- Smart Collections creates rule-based dynamic collections
- Duplicate Detector finds duplicate projects using hash comparison
- Health Calculator computes project health metrics
- Audio Player provides in-app playback of exported audio
- Archive Service handles project backup and archiving

**Data Storage**
- SQLite Database (file-based database) with FTS5 (Full-Text Search engine) stores all project metadata and enables full-text search
- Configuration stores user preferences and settings
- Thumbnail Cache stores generated waveform previews

**External Resources**
- `.als` Project Files are read-only parsed for metadata
- Exported Audio Files are linked to projects and can be played
- Ableton Live Installations are detected and used for launching projects
- Ableton Link Network is monitored for device discovery

**Data Flow**
- UI components interact with services, which read/write to the database
- Scanner and Watcher monitor project files and update the database
- Services like Export Tracker and Archive Service interact with both files and database
- All user preferences and window state are persisted in configuration

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository** (using git - version control system):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ableton-hub.git
   cd ableton-hub/ableton_hub
   ```
   
   **Note**: If downloading as ZIP instead of using git clone, extract the ZIP and navigate to the `Ableton-Hub-main` folder (the folder name when downloading from GitHub).

2. **Create a virtual environment** (isolated Python environment):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install with dev dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

5. **Format code**:
   ```bash
   black src tests
   ruff check src tests --fix
   ```

6. **Type checking**:
   ```bash
   mypy src
   ```

### Application Data Locations

The application stores data in platform-specific locations:

**Windows:**
- Config & Database: `%APPDATA%\AbletonHub\`
- Thumbnail Cache: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AbletonHub\cache\`

**macOS:**
- Config & Database: `~/Library/Application Support/AbletonHub/`
- Thumbnail Cache: `~/Library/Caches/AbletonHub/`

**Linux:**
- Config & Database: `~/.local/share/AbletonHub/`
- Thumbnail Cache: `~/.cache/AbletonHub/`

### Database

The application uses SQLite with FTS5 (Full-Text Search) for project metadata. The database file is located in the application data directory (see above) and is automatically created and migrated on first run.

### Configuration

User preferences, window state, and settings are stored in a JSON configuration file in the application data directory. The configuration is automatically loaded and saved.

### Version Management

The application version uses a **single source of truth** pattern:

**To release a new version:**
1. Update `pyproject.toml` → `[project]` → `version`
2. Update `src/__init__.py` → `WHATS_NEW` dictionary with new features

**How it works:**
- `pyproject.toml` defines the package version
- `src/__init__.py` reads from `importlib.metadata` when installed, or uses fallback
- `src/app.py` and `src/ui/main_window.py` import `__version__` from the package
- The About dialog pulls "What's New" content from `src/__init__.py` → `get_whats_new_html()`

> **Note**: The "What's New" section is maintained in `src/__init__.py` and displayed in the in-app About dialog. Feature lists in the README are updated as needed for documentation.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are solutions to common problems:

### I can't install Python or pip isn't working

**macOS:**

### Default Project Locations

The application can automatically detect default Ableton project folders (only existing directories are suggested):

**macOS:**
- `~/Music/Ableton/`
- `~/Documents/Ableton/`
- `~/Library/Application Support/Ableton/`
- `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/`

**Windows:**
- `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Ableton\`
- `%USERPROFILE%\Music\Ableton\`
- `%APPDATA%\Ableton\`
- `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Ableton\User Library\`

**Linux:**
- `~/Music/Ableton/`
- `~/Documents/Ableton/`

> **Note**: Live installation detection (for launching projects) searches different locations than project folders. The application automatically detects installed Live versions from standard installation paths.

### Technical Details

#### .als File Parsing

The application parses Ableton Live Set (`.als`) files to extract metadata. The parser reads:
- **Project Information**: Name, Live version, creation/modification dates
- **Tempo & Time Signature**: Current song tempo and time signature
- **Track Information**: Audio tracks, MIDI tracks, return tracks, master track
- **Device & Plugin Data**: All devices and plugins used in the project
- **Arrangement Data**: Arrangement length (bars), automation status
- **Sample References**: Linked audio files and samples

The parser handles `.als` files from Live 9.x through Live 12.x. The `.als` format is XML-based (eXtensible Markup Language), and the parser uses standard XML parsing with error handling for malformed files.

#### Live Version Compatibility

- **Detected Versions**: Automatically detects Live 9.x, 10.x, 11.x, and 12.x installations
- **Launch Support**: Can launch projects with any detected Live version
- **Version-Specific Features**: Some metadata extraction may vary by Live version

#### Ableton Link Integration

The application includes Ableton Link network discovery using the `zeroconf` library (zero-configuration networking). It can:
- Discover devices on the Link network
- Monitor Link network status
- Display device information (name, IP address)

This does not interfere with Live's Link functionality and operates in read-only mode.

#### Data Privacy & Security

- **Local-Only Storage**: All data is stored locally; no cloud sync or external services
- **No Network Communication**: The application does not send any data to external servers
- **Read-Only Access**: The application only reads `.als` files and does not modify them
- **Export Detection**: Uses fuzzy matching (approximate string matching) to link exported audio files to projects (no modification of export files)

#### Technical Stack

- **UI Framework**: PyQt6 (Qt 6.6+) for cross-platform GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- **Database**: SQLite (file-based database) with FTS5 (Full-Text Search engine) for full-text search
- **Async Operations**: `qasync` (async/await support library) for async/await support with Qt event loop
- **File Watching**: `watchdog` (file system monitoring library) for real-time file system monitoring
- **Audio Playback**: Qt Multimedia (QMediaPlayer) for cross-platform audio preview

#### Project Structure & Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern:
- **UI Layer**: PyQt6 widgets and dialogs (presentation layer)
