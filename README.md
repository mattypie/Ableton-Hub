# Ableton Hub

**Version 1.0.4**

## What is Ableton Hub?

Ableton Hub is a desktop application that helps you organize, manage, and discover your Ableton Live projects across multiple locations. Whether your projects are on your computer, external drives, network shares, or cloud storage, Ableton Hub scans and indexes them all in one place. Creating collections of your projects and mapping exports to projects with deep learning of your project stats.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Find Projects quickly** - Search and Sort across all your projects by Name, Tempo, Key, Age, Length, Bars, Tracks, Plugins, or Tags
- **Discover Similar Projects** - Find projects with similar plugins, devices, tempo, and structure using advanced similarity analysis
- **Organize with Collections** - Create albums, EPs, or custom collections to group related projects
- **Track your Exports** - Automatically find and link exported audio files to their source projects
- **Preview Audio Exports** - Click on Ableton project to cycle thru all audio exports
- **Launch with Live** - Open any project directly in Ableton Live with your preferred version
- **Discover patterns** - See which plugins and devices you use most across your projects

Built with Python (programming language) and PyQt6 (GUI framework), Ableton Hub provides powerful tools for music producers to maintain their project libraries and seamlessly integrate with their Ableton Live workflow.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python** (programming language): Version 3.11 or higher
- **Operating System**: 
  - macOS 10.15+ (Catalina or later)
  - Windows 10/11
  - Linux (with Qt6 support)

## 🚀 Installation

Choose the installation method that works best for you. If you're new to Python or command-line tools, see the detailed platform-specific guides below.

### Method 1: Install from GitHub (Recommended)

This is the easiest method - pip (Python package installer) will automatically download and install everything you need.

**macOS:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/EazyTom/ableton-hub.git
ableton-hub  # Run the application (this is the command, not a directory)
```

**Windows:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/EazyTom/ableton-hub.git
ableton-hub  # Run the application (this is the command, not a directory)
```

This method will:
- ✅ Automatically install all dependencies (PyQt6, SQLAlchemy, ML libraries, etc.)
- ✅ Create the `ableton-hub` command in your PATH (system path) - you can run it from anywhere
- ✅ Work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ Allow easy updates: `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/yourusername/ableton-hub.git`

> **Note**: `ableton-hub` is the executable command created by pip installation. You don't need to navigate to any directory - just run `ableton-hub` from anywhere in your terminal after installation.

> **Note**: This method requires Python 3.11+ to be installed. Most macOS users already have Python installed. See platform-specific guides below if you need help checking or installing Python.

### Method 2: Download Source and Install

If you prefer to download the source code and install manually:

1. **Download the source code**:
   - Go to the GitHub repository and click "Code" → "Download ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer

2. **Open Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows)**:
   - macOS: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and press Enter
   - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type "cmd" or "powershell", and press Enter

3. **Navigate to the extracted folder**:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   cd ~/Downloads/Ableton-Hub-main
   
   # Windows (adjust path as needed)
   cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\Ableton-Hub-main
   ```
   
   **Note**: When you download the ZIP from GitHub, it extracts to a folder named `Ableton-Hub-main`. Make sure you're inside this folder before running the installation commands.

4. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended - keeps dependencies isolated):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Windows
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

5. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the application**:
   
   **Option A: Command Line**
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```
   
   **Option B: Windows Launcher Script** (Windows only)
   - Double-click `run-ableton-hub.bat` to run the application
   - **Tip**: Create a desktop shortcut to `run-ableton-hub.bat` for easy access:
     1. Right-click `run-ableton-hub.bat` → "Create shortcut"
     2. Drag the shortcut to your desktop
     3. Rename it to "Ableton Hub" if desired

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are solutions to common problems:

### I can't install Python or pip isn't working

**macOS:**
- Most Macs come with Python installed. Check by opening Terminal and typing: `python3 --version`
- If Python isn't installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use Homebrew: `brew install python3`
- See the [macOS Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION_MAC.md) for detailed help

**Windows:**
- Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
- See the [Windows Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION_WINDOWS.md) for detailed help

### The app won't start

- Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed (check with `python --version` or `python3 --version`)
- If you used Method 2 (source installation), make sure you activated the virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Try reinstalling: `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/EazyTom/ableton-hub.git`
- On Linux, you may need additional system libraries for PyQt6 (GUI framework)

### I don't see my projects

- Check that locations are added and active in the sidebar
- Verify the scan completed successfully (check the status bar at the bottom)
- Make sure `.als` files are in the folders you're scanning
- Try clicking "Scan All Locations" in the toolbar
- Check the "View" menu → "Show Missing Projects" to see if projects were marked as missing

### Audio playback isn't working

- Make sure you have exported audio files (WAV, MP3, etc.) in your project folders
- On Linux, you may need to install audio codecs: `sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good`
- Try clearing the thumbnail cache: Tools → Clear Thumbnail Cache

### I'm confused by the interface

- Check out the [First Time Setup Guide](docs/FIRST_TIME_SETUP.md) for a walkthrough
- See the [Quick Reference](docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for common tasks
- Browse the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) for answers to common questions

### Something went wrong

- Check the status bar at the bottom of the window for error messages
- **View Logs**: Use Help → View Logs to see detailed error information and recent activity
- Check log files in the logs directory (see Settings → Logging tab for location)
- Try resetting the database: Tools → Reset Database (⚠️ This will delete all your indexed projects)
- If the problem persists, open an issue on GitHub with details about what happened and include relevant log entries
