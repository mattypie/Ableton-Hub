  - Linux (with Qt6 support)

## 🚀 Installation

### From Source

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ableton-hub.git
   cd ableton-hub/ableton_hub
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   
   **Option A: Command Line**
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```
   
   **Option B: Double-Click Launcher (Windows)**
   - Double-click `run_ableton_hub.bat` to run with console output
   - Or double-click `run_ableton_hub.pyw` to run without console window
   
   **Option C: Create Standalone Executable (Optional)**
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   pyinstaller --name="Ableton Hub" --windowed --icon=resources/images/AProject.ico --add-data "resources;resources" --add-data "src;src" src/main.py
   ```
   This creates a standalone executable in the `dist` folder that can be run without Python installed.
   
   > **Note**: The executable will include all dependencies, so the first build may take several minutes.

### Using pip (Recommended)

**Option 1: Install from GitHub (Current)**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/ableton-hub.git
ableton-hub
```

**Option 2: Install from PyPI (When Published)**
```bash
pip install ableton-hub
ableton-hub
```

Both methods will:
- ✅ Automatically install all dependencies (PyQt6, SQLAlchemy, ML libraries, etc.)
- ✅ Create the `ableton-hub` command in your PATH
- ✅ Work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ Allow easy updates: `pip install --upgrade ableton-hub`

> **Note**: The pip method requires Python 3.11+ to be installed. For users without Python, use the standalone executable (see "From Source" → Option C).

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Launch the application** using one of the methods above
2. **Add your first location**:
   - Click "Add Location" in the sidebar
   - Select a folder containing Ableton projects
   - Choose location type (Local, Network, Cloud, etc.)

   - Wait for the scan to complete
   - Projects will appear in the main view
4. **Create a collection**:
   - Click "New Collection" in the sidebar
   - Name your collection and choose a type
   - Drag projects into the collection
5. **Search and filter**:
   - Use the search bar to find projects
   - Use date filters, location filters, or tag filters
   - Search for specific plugins or devices

## 🛠️ Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Install with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Format code
black src tests
ruff check src tests --fix

# Type checking
mypy src
```

### Application Data Locations

The application stores data in platform-specific locations:

**Windows:**
- Config & Database: `%APPDATA%\AbletonHub\`
- Thumbnail Cache: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AbletonHub\cache\`

**macOS:**
- Config & Database: `~/Library/Application Support/AbletonHub/`
- Thumbnail Cache: `~/Library/Caches/AbletonHub/`

**Linux:**
- Config & Database: `~/.local/share/AbletonHub/`
- Thumbnail Cache: `~/.cache/AbletonHub/`

### Database

The application uses SQLite with FTS5 (Full-Text Search) for project metadata. The database file is located in the application data directory (see above) and is automatically created and migrated on first run.

### Configuration

User preferences, window state, and settings are stored in a JSON configuration file in the application data directory. The configuration is automatically loaded and saved.

### Version Management

The application version uses a **single source of truth** pattern:

**To release a new version:**
1. Update `pyproject.toml` → `[project]` → `version`
2. Update `src/__init__.py` → `WHATS_NEW` dictionary with new features
3. Update `README.md` → "What's New" section (for documentation)

**How it works:**
- `pyproject.toml` defines the package version
- `src/__init__.py` reads from `importlib.metadata` when installed, or uses fallback
- `src/app.py` and `src/ui/main_window.py` import `__version__` from the package
- The About dialog pulls "What's New" content from `src/__init__.py` → `get_whats_new_html()`

> **Note**: The README "What's New" section is kept manually for documentation purposes, but the in-app About dialog auto-generates from `src/__init__.py`.

### Troubleshooting

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed and in PATH
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify PyQt6 is properly installed (may require system libraries on Linux)

**Projects not appearing:**
- Check that locations are added and active in the sidebar
- Verify the scan completed successfully (check the status bar)
- Ensure `.als` files are in the scanned directories

**Audio playback not working:**
- Verify audio codecs are available (Qt Multimedia backends)
- On Linux, may need `gstreamer` plugins: `sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good`

**Database issues:**
- Database can be reset from Settings (this will delete all indexed projects)
- Database file can be manually backed up from the application data directory

## 🔍 For Ableton Developers & Engineers

This section provides technical details that may be of interest to Ableton developers.

### .als File Parsing

The application parses Ableton Live Set (`.als`) files to extract metadata. The parser reads:
- **Project Information**: Name, Live version, creation/modification dates
- **Tempo & Time Signature**: Current song tempo and time signature
- **Track Information**: Audio tracks, MIDI tracks, return tracks, master track
- **Device & Plugin Data**: All devices and plugins used in the project
- **Arrangement Data**: Arrangement length (bars), automation status
- **Sample References**: Linked audio files and samples

The parser handles `.als` files from Live 9.x through Live 12.x. The `.als` format is XML-based, and the parser uses standard XML parsing with error handling for malformed files.

### Live Version Compatibility

- **Detected Versions**: Automatically detects Live 9.x, 10.x, 11.x, and 12.x installations
- **Launch Support**: Can launch projects with any detected Live version
- **Version-Specific Features**: Some metadata extraction may vary by Live version

### Ableton Link Integration

The application includes Ableton Link network discovery using the `zeroconf` library. It can:
- Discover devices on the Link network
- Monitor Link network status
- Display device information (name, IP address)

This does not interfere with Live's Link functionality and operates in read-only mode.

### Data Privacy & Security

- **Local-Only Storage**: All data is stored locally; no cloud sync or external services
- **No Network Communication**: The application does not send any data to external servers
- **Read-Only Access**: The application only reads `.als` files and does not modify them
- **Export Detection**: Uses fuzzy matching to link exported audio files to projects (no modification of export files)

### Technical Stack

- **UI Framework**: PyQt6 (Qt 6.6+) for cross-platform GUI
- **Database**: SQLite with FTS5 for full-text search
- **Async Operations**: `qasync` for async/await support with Qt event loop
- **File Watching**: `watchdog` for real-time file system monitoring
- **Audio Playback**: Qt Multimedia (QMediaPlayer) for cross-platform audio preview

### Project Structure & Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern:
- **UI Layer**: PyQt6 widgets and dialogs (presentation)
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and domain services
- **Data Layer**: SQLAlchemy ORM with repository pattern
- **Utils**: Cross-platform utilities and helpers

This separation allows for easy testing and future enhancements without major refactoring.
