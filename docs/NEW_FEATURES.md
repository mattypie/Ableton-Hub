## ❌ NOT YET DEVELOPED
- ❌ Research Ableton Live native lesson format and how to load lessons from their location in the Ableton install (find location for Win and Mac)
- ❌ Add browser to view Ableton lessons in the native installed location (link to them from the Lesson table of contents)
- ❌ Add Lessons area in Learning section that goes to the Lesson TOC (Currently hidden per user request until paths and display methods are resolved)
- ❌ Locate or allow user to define Ableton pack location (Basic pack browsing exists, but user-defined location configuration not yet implemented)
- ❌ Load the official Pack TOC (it seems like a lesson also?)
- ❌ Determine best way to keep Stats on Pack usage, find unused/never used Packs (does this have to come from scanning projects?)
